There are two sections to the project, the client and the server.

The client source code consists of react components which are used to display the website and add reactivity.

The server source code handles API calls and databsae queries.

To run the project you need node and postgreSQL (versions disclosed in the report)
Instructions as to how to precisely run the project are in the report.

The database.ts, and server.ts files have most of the code and include implementations of features like hashing and SQL injection.
They have acompanying test files also.

There is a second demo video showing that the user's session remains after closing thier browser and opening the site again. I did not get it in the original video.

In the images folder on the server side there should be two images by default. They are included this provided code but are not on the remote repo since I had that folder ignored.
If cloning the repo you should take those two images and copy them into the same location with the cloned code.
